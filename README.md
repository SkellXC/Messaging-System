# Messaging-System
An old program I wrote in y10/11 when we were given access to a folder with read/write permissions.
We couldn't create or delete files but we could edit and view the existing files. It was forgotten about after a while since we moved to outlook but eventually I remembered about it and started trying different things.
I then realized that I could use to to pass messages to my friends who sat in different places in the classroom (since phones don't exist).
I created a program that would allow you to type messages and display it in the usual text/sms format.

The main issue at the moment is that the only way to view a new message is to send a message yourself. Attempted solution was to check time the file was updated but this wasn't possible because of permissions or something else (its been a few years since). Teacher couldn't think of any other solutions.
Tried to use Threads to have it auto update but it was too complicated for me at the time.

Also includes a command that lets you change your username to whoever you want which in some circles might be considered a security risk.
